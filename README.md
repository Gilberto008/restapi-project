- **Editor**: Users assigned the role of an editor, with specific permissions to modify and edit content within the application.
- **User**: Standard users who have access to the basic functionalities of the application. MongoDB is utilized for data storage, providing a flexible and scalable database solution for your project. Define and assign these roles judiciously to ensure proper access control and functionality within your MongoDB-backed system.

## CORS Handling

Securely handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to prevent unauthorized access.

## MVC Pattern

Organize the codebase using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Local Development

## Configuration with .env

This project utilizes a configuration file named `.env` to store sensitive information. It's crucial to note that the `.env` file is listed in the `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being exposed publicly.

### Setting up .env

Before running the project, create your own `.env` file in the root directory and define the following variables:

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET= [your access token secret] REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET= [your refresh token secret] DATABASE_URI= [your MongoDB database connection URI]

Replace `[your access token secret]`, `[your refresh token secret]`, and `[your MongoDB database connection URI]` with your own secure values.

### Example .env file

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=myAccessTokenSecret REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=myRefreshTokenSecret DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
